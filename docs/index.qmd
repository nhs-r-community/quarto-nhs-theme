It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [GitHub Actions](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. This is an example of a quarto website with an NHS Theme --- it is a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.

[Quarto.org](https://quarto.org) is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!
