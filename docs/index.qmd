It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [GitHub Actions](http://github.com). 

This is an example of a Quarto website with an NHS Theme --- it is a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about your work using the same reproducible workflow you and your colleagues use for analyses.

[Quarto.org](https://quarto.org) is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials For general guidance on how to use Quarto, please refer to the [Quarto Tutorial](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/) site, and check out the [R-Studio guide](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/quarto-workflows/rstudio.html).
