This is very new and incredibly cool. This is an example of a quarto website with an NHS Theme — it is a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"
