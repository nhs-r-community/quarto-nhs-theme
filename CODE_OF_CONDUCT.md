# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

Where behaviour of any project maintainers requires investigation, this can be raised as an issue and/or directed to the central administration team via [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net).

In all cases, documentation and conduct should reflect [NHS Values](https://www.hee.nhs.uk/about/our-values/nhs-constitutional-values-hub-0).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/), follows [NHS Open Source Policy guidance](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-policy/blob/main/open-source-policy.md#d-contribution-and-community-guidelines), and is recommended for use across NHS-R Community repositories.
